# CarTrafficLightSimulator
Fully graphical Java Swing application that uses event handlers, listeners and incorporates Javaâ€™s concurrency functionality and the use of threads. This application displays time, traffic signals and other information for traffic analysts. The GUI design includes viewing ports/panels to display the following components of the simulation:

1. Current time stamps in 1 second intervals
2. Real-time Traffic light display for three major intersections
3. X, Y positions and speed of up to 3 cars as they traverse each of the 3 intersections

Additionaly, vehicles have user-adjustable speeds; stoplights are able to be paused and resumed.

To Run:
Clone this Git Repo and run 'Run CarTrafficLightSimulator.bat". The included batch file will open the program's Javadoc documentation in your default web browser, as well as execute the Run CarTrafficLightSimulator.jar program file.
